# ReizTech Task - Filterable Country List



Check it out deployed: https://reiz-tech-task-ts.vercel.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a small app created with React as a JS library for UI, where you can filter the countries by Name and Region (ascending and descending), and also to see the countries in Oceania and countries smaller than Lithuania by area. To style the components I used TailwindCSS. To take a step further in my challenge I used TypeScript. And Axios for fetching data from the API RestCountries.

  - To run the local version `npm start`

## What I have learned

While I was building the app I learned how to use React with TypeScript. Previously I have built small projects with React and TypeScript separatelly, but never a combination of both.

## What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

Most challenging part was using the TypeScript in combination with React. Especially when you sending events as a props since React uses its own event system. Another challenge related to this was adding the pagination. But as one of the top 3 JS libraries/frameworks along with Vue and Angular, it's not very hard to find a solution on Stackoverflow, YouTube or blogs by developers if you know how to ask properly. Not only Google but chatGPT can be helpful as well, especially for errors in the console.
